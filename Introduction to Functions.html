	<p>Today you will learn about how to write functions in JavaScript.  It will be very similar to what 
		we learned in Python.  In today's lesson I will write the JavaScript code inline of the body
		tags, which I wouldn't normally do.  We have seen a few functions written with the examples
		we've already seen.  As always a function must be created then called.</p> 
		
		<h1>Syntax</h1>  
		The syntax for creating a function is the same as Arduino code and which is <br>
		<br>
		function FunctionName() {  <br>
		Instruction  	<br>
		Instruction   	<br>
		Instruction		<br>
		}  				<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		In order to call a function you would use FunctionName() in the script tags or have a button call it.
		<br>
		<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
		<div id="Example1">
			<h1>Example #1</h1>
			For example the following code is used to calculate the area of a 4x5 rectangle.	<br>
			function AreaRectangle() {  <br>
			var AreaRect=4*5;  <br>
			document.getElementById("Rectangle").innerHTML=('The area of the rectangle is ' + AreaRect ); <br>
			}  <br>
			<br>
			When AreaRectangle(); is called the following will appear (see below).  <br>
			<span id="Rectangle"></span>
			
			<script>
				function AreaRectangle() {
				var AreaRect=4*5;
				document.getElementById("Rectangle").innerHTML=('The area of the rectangle is ' + AreaRect );
					}
					
				AreaRectangle();	
			</script>	
		</div>
		
		<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
		<div id="Example2">
			<h1>Example #2</h1>
			<p>Often, when a function is written variable will be "passed through" it.  The syntax
			will include the variables in the brackets. <b>NOTE:  IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE 
			VARIABLES USED IN CREATING THE FUNCTION NOT HAVE THE SAME NAME AS OTHERS TRHOUGHOUT
			THE WEBPAGE!!</b>
			</p>
			<br>
			var x=10; <br>
			var y=15;  <br>

			
			function AreaTriangle(base,height) {<br>
				var AreaTri=0.5*base*height;  <br>
				document.getElementById("Triangle").innerHTML='The area of the triangle is '+ AreaTri; <br>
				}  <br>
			<br>
			
			<button onclick="AreaTriangle(x,y)">Click here to call the function.</button>
			<span id="Triangle">The answer will appear here!</span>
			<script>
				var x=10;
				var y=15;
				
				function AreaTriangle(base,height) {
					var AreaTri=0.5*base*height;
					document.getElementById("Triangle").innerHTML=('The area of the triangle is '+ AreaTri);
					}
					
				//AreaTriangle(x,y); //Calls the function if button wasn't in place. NOTE: I didn't use base or height in this line!
			</script>
